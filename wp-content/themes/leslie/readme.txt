== ABOUT LESLIE ==

Supported post formats: custom post type "custom_profile" and standard post only. Works perfectly in desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://themes.tradesouthwest.com/leslie.

== NOTES ==

* Due to the multiple template layout variations of this theme some content areas will have very close margins when page is smaller. The latest version is a good fix for the many screen sizes that the last version was not happy with.
